Including artificial/synthetic introns into cDNA sequences can signficiant increase gene expression. Intron mediated enchancement of gene expression can be due to a variety of mechanisms, including by increasing the rate of transcription. Intron mediated enhancement occurs in *C. elegans* [(Crane *et al* 2019)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6591249/). Although intron mediated enhancement has to be specifically studied in *Strongyloides spp.* there is evidence that the prescence of introns does not prevent gene expression (e.g. intron-inclusive eGFP; [Junio *et al* 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17945217/) ).  

In Optimize Sequences mode, users may input a desired number of introns, up to a maximum of three unique introns. The Fire lab established three unique introns, spaced equidistantly within a gene as canon [(Fire Lab Vector Kit 1995)](https://media.addgene.org/cms/files/Vec95.pdf); this configuration is thus set as default, and is recommended.  

Intron sequences for insertion into the optimized sequence are the three canonical artificial intron sequences established by the Fire lab. This app divides the optimized cDNA sequence at 3 hypothetical intron insertion sites spaced approximately equidistantly. Insertion sites are *C. elegans* exon splice sites: preferably the stringent consensus sequences (‘AAG^G’, ‘AAG^A’, ‘CAG^G’, ‘CAG^A’) but minimal consensus sequences are used if more stringent sites are not present or if there are fewer than 3 possible insertion sites (‘AG^G’, ‘AG^A’) ( [Redemann *et al* 2011](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21278743/), [*Cis-* Splicing in Worms *in* *C. elegans* II, 1997](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK20075/). For all insertion sites, '^' symbol indicates the exact insertion site.  

Once hypothetical intron insertion sites have been identified, the application inserts the user-specified number of introns, using the 5’ insertion site first and continuing in the 3’ direction. In *C. elegans*, the location of the intron site influences the degree of intron mediated enhancement, such that a single 5′-intron is more effective than a single 3′-intron. Therefore when only 1 or 2 introns are desired, 3 possible intron insertion sites are identified, and filled as needed, starting from the 5′ site.
